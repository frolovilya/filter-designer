## Usage

### Finite Impulse Response

Using window method for FIR filter design. 
Filter cofficients are generated by applying an inverse FFT on the ideal frequency response and then multiplying with a selected window function.

Number of filter coefficients is either calculated based on the target Attenuation (dB) and Transition Length (Hz) or entered manually.
Using odd number of coefficients allows for a linear phase response.

Frequency and phase responses are calculated with a direct FFT of the filter coefficients.

Filter coefficients `c[k]` must be convolved with a sample buffer to apply a FIR filter:

```
Vout[i] = c[k] * Vin[i-k] + c[k-1] * Vin[i-(k-1)] + ... + c[0] * Vin[i]
```

Where `Vin[]` is a input circle sample buffer of size `n`, `k` is a total number of filter coefficients, `Vin[i]` is a last input sample, `Vout[i]` is a current output filtered sample.


### Infinite Impulse Response

Basic analog filter replication. Using RC circuit for a low-pass and CR circuit for a high-pass filters.

```
Vin --C--+-- Vout
         |
         R
         |
         g
         
Vin --R--+-- Vout
         |
         C
         |
         g
```

Frequency and phase responses are calculated by simulating sine waves of various frequencies and applying IIR filters directly.

IIR filter with coefficients `c[3]` must be applied the following way:

```
Vout[i] = c[0] * Vin[i] + c[1] * Vin[i-1] + c[2] * Vout[i-1]
```

Where `Vin[i]` is a current input sample, `Vout[i]` current output filtered sample, `Vin[i-1]` and `Vout[i-1]` are previous input and output samples used as a feedback for the IIR filter.



## Build

The project depends on [Qt](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/get-and-install-qt.html), [FFTW3](https://www.fftw.org/download.html) and [Boost](https://www.boost.org/) libraries.

Qt path is passed to the CMake build via `-DQT_PATH` option, since you may wish to install it via Qt Maintenance Tool to any directory.
FFTW3 and Boost must be available in you _/usr/local/include_ for CMake to resolve the paths.

```
mkdir build; cd build
cmake ../ -DQT_PATH=~/Dev/tools/QT/6.7.0/macos

make
```
